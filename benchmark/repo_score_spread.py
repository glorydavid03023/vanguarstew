"""Report the spread of per-repo composite scores across a multi-repo replay artifact.

A multi-repo run scores each repository independently and rolls them into a headline
``composite_mean``; the headline hides how *evenly* the agent did across repos. This read-only
utility reports the ``min``/``max``/``range`` of per-repo ``composite_mean`` across the scored repos,
so a dashboard can flag a run that looks fine on average but is carried by one repo. A
``--generalization`` artifact additionally reports the spread within each ``tuned``/``held_out``
partition.

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its input. A non-numeric, boolean, or ``NaN``/``inf`` score is
skipped rather than crashing or being coerced, and a slice with no usable per-repo score yields
``None`` spread fields.
